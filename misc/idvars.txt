IDCNTRY;A three-digit code identifying the countries and economies: 152 = Bíobio-Metropolitana-Valparaíso (Chile), 156 = Shanghai (China), 170 = Colombia, 276 = Germany*, 392 = Kumagaya, Shizuoka, Toda (Japan), 484 = Mexico, 724 = Madrid (Spain), 826 = England (UK).
IDSCHOOL;A four-digit code identifying schools within a country/economy. These IDs do not have any relationship to the national school IDs.
IDTEACH;A two-digit code identifying teachers within a school. This ID was initially intended to take only values 01 and 02, indicating whether the teacher was the first or second sampled teacher from the school. However, there were many deviations from this strategy and so this numbering convention does not hold true in all cases.
IDSTUDENT;A three-digit code identifying students within a class.
SCH_ID;A 10-digit unique identifier for each school in the study. This is the combination of IDCNTRY and IDSCHOOL, with leading zeros, separated by a hyphen. For example, 00152-0049 indicates school 49 in B-M-V (Chile). We recommend using this identifier as a string (instead of a numeric) variable for merging purposes.
T_ID;A 15-digit unique identifier for each teacher in the study. This is the combination of IDCNTRY, IDSCHOOL and IDTEACH, with leading zeros, separated by hyphens. For example, 00152-0049-0001 indicates teacher 1 from school 49 in B-M-V (Chile). We recommend using this identifier as a string (instead of a numeric) variable for merging purposes.
S_ID;A 20-digit unique identifier for each student in the study. This is the combination of IDCNTRY, IDSCHOOL, IDTEACH, and IDSTUDENT, with leading zeros, separated by hyphens. For example, 00152-0049-0001-0015 indicates student 15 in the class of teacher 1 from school 49 in B-M-V (Chile). We recommend using this identifier as a string (instead of a numeric) variable for merging purposes.
