This directory contains the following set of files:

01_variable_exploration_[]: Rmd files to create html reports that explore the GTI data using psych::describe() and scatterplots of baseline and posttest measures. Reports also contain information on items used in each scale.

02_mi_[]: Rmd files to run measurement invariance (MI) analyses. *non_cog* contains 15 student-reported outcome variables whereas *non_cog_fin* contains final selection of 8 student-reported outcome variables. *[]removed* indicates how many out of the eight countries available were randomly removed. This approach was taken as MI did not hold across all countries. The files ending in *_select* repeat MI analyses for a selected subgroup of countries that show MI.
