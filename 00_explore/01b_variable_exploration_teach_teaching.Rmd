# Classroom management {#cm}

### Pre-questionnaire
  
* **TA_CM_DISRUPT**:	Scale measuring the teacher’s perception of classroom disruptions in the target class in mathematics, calculated as the mean of TQA07A to TQA07C using a 1 (strongly disagree) - 4 (strongly agree) scale. Question: ***To what extent do you disagree or agree with the following statements?***
  - When the lesson begins, I have to wait quite a long time for these students to quieten down.  
  - I lose quite a lot of time because of students interrupting the lesson.  
  - There is much disruptive noise in this classroom.  
* **TA_CM_TEACHMAN**:	Scale measuring the teacher’s perception of the teacher’s management of classroom disruptions, calculated as the mean of TQA07F, TQA07G, TQA07I, and TQA07J using a 1 (strongly disagree) - 4 (strongly agree) scale. Question: ***To what extent do you disagree or agree with the following statements?***
  - I manage to stop disruptions quickly.  
  - I react to disruptions in such a way that the students stop disturbing learning.  
  - I am immediately aware of students doing something else.  
  - I am aware of what is happening in the classroom, even if he or she is busy with an individual student.

# Quality of subject matter {#qs}  

### Pre-questionnaire

* **TA_OTL**:	Scale (yes/no) measuring opportunity-to-learn for mathematical tasks, focusing on prerequisites necessary for the understanding of quadratic equations, calculated as the total of TQA03A to TQA03E. Question: ***For each task please indicate (yes or no) whether you encountered these types of mathematical tasks.***
  - Plotting the graph of y = x².  
  - Solving a problem like 𝑥2 − 4 = 0 by inspection.  
  - Finding all values of x for which (x − 4)(x + 5) = 0.  
  - Using the binomial formula (a+b)²=a²+2ab+b² when solving a problem like 𝑥2 + 6𝑥 + 9 = 0.  
  - Solving any quadratic equation (example: 4x²+6x+3 = 0).  
* **TA_CLARITY**:	Scale measuring the teacher’s perception of clarity instruction when teaching the target class in mathematics, calculated as the mean of TQA04A to TQA04D using a 1 (never or almost never) - 4 (always) scale. Question: ***And how often do you do the following things?***  
  - I present a summary of recently learned content.  
  - I set goals at the beginning of instruction.  
  - I explain what I expect these students to learn.  
  - I explain how new and old topics are related.

```

### Post-questionnaire

* **TL_SUM**:	Sum score computed based on derived variables for subtopic coverage from the teacher log (TA23). Derived variables for subtopic coverage from the teacher log were calculated by taking the weighted sum of subtopic coverage ratings, where a lesson was counted with weight 1 if the subtopic was covered fully, weight 0.5 if the subtopic was covered to a minor extent, and weight 0 if the subtopic was not covered at all. ***INSTRUCTION: Please enter date and duration for each lesson on quadratic equations. In each column corresponding to a subtopic write 0, 1 or 2. 0 = not taught; 1 = minor focus; 2 = major focus***  
  - TL03_SUM: Subtopic coverage rating for handling expressions.
