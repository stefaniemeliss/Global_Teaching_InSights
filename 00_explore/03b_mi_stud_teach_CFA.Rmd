Previous results showed that when three countries are removed systematically, measurement invariance (MI) in the non-cognitive outcome measures can be established. However, there were three different possible combinations that achieved this outcome. This markdown document compares re-runs the measurement invariance test for all three data subsets for the student ratings of teaching-related constructs.

# Approach

To determine measurement invariance (MI) for the questionnaire responses given by students, CFA was applied. More specifically, for each questionnaire scale, we first defined a CFA model where all items in the scale are loading on a single factor. All items were defined as being ordered categorical. 

> factor =~ item_1 + item_2 + ... + item_n  

This model was first fitted on all available data across all countries, model fit indices were extracted and a path diagram was created.  

Next, we fitted the model to each country separately to extract model fit indices for each country. These are summarised in a table.  

For the multi-group CFA, the same model is fitted in all groups. To establish metric (or weak) MI,  the pattern of salient (non-zero) and non-salient (zero) loadings was compared across groups. This was done by extracting the p-values associated with each loading and binarising it through comparison against an alpha value of .05. In a next step, we checked whether  there is any variance in the binarised p values across countries for each item. If the variance was zero for each item, we can assume that the same pattern of salient and non-salient loadings occurs across countries.  

To determine MI, a configural, a metric and a scalar model were fitted and compared. The model fit indices and changes therein were summarised in a table.  

The outlined procedure was followed for each questionnaire scale of interest. The results are shown below.
